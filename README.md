# Boston-House-Price-Prediction

The Boston Housing Dataset is a classic regression problem where the goal is to predict the median value of owner-occupied homes (medv) in $1000s based on various features of the housing data. Here is a step-by-step approach to solve this problem and achieve a score of over 0.9:

### Steps to Solve the Problem:

1. **Data Preparation:**
   * Load the dataset.
   * Explore the dataset to understand the distribution of features and target variable.
   * Check for missing values and handle them appropriately.
   * Perform feature engineering if necessary (e.g., creating new features or transforming existing ones).
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   * Visualize the relationships between features and the target variable.
   * Identify correlations between features to understand multicollinearity.
   * Plot histograms, boxplots, scatter plots, etc., for deeper insights.
3. **Data Preprocessing:**
   * Standardize or normalize features if required.
   * Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
4. **Model Selection:**
   * Identify and select appropriate regression models for the task.
   * Some potential models include:
     * Linear Regression
     * Decision Tree Regressor
     * Random Forest Regressor
     * Gradient Boosting Regressor
     * Support Vector Regressor
     * Neural Networks
5. **Model Training and Evaluation:**
   * Train multiple models using the training dataset.
   * Evaluate model performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (RÂ²) score.
   * Perform cross-validation to ensure the model's robustness.
6. **Hyperparameter Tuning:**
   * Use techniques such as Grid Search or Random Search to find the best hyperparameters for the models.
   * Evaluate the tuned models on the validation set.
7. **Model Optimization:**
   * Apply techniques to further improve model performance such as feature selection, feature importance analysis, and ensemble methods.
8. **Final Evaluation:**
   * Select the best model based on performance metrics.
   * Evaluate the final model on the test set to ensure it generalizes well.
9. **Deployment:**
   * Once a satisfactory model is found, it can be deployed for practical use.
   * Consider the computational cost and time efficiency of the model in a real-world scenario.
